It was built to help you feel well and stay well.</p><p>Frédéric believes wellness is often mistaken for quick fixes or surface-level solutions. But true wellbeing goes deeper. It begins when your foundation works. When your essential systems and functions are supported and maintained, you feel balanced, cope with anything and perform at your best: physically, mentally and emotionally. Wellbeing is not a destination. It’s a dialogue. A dynamic journey that gives you the freedom to grow, adapt and become who you are meant to be.</p>",

By doing so, it ensures seamless and effective integration at the deepest cellular level, optimising the supplement’s impact.<br/><br/>Liquid Intelligence™ is designed to target your body’s four essential systems and functions. These include the heart, brain, digestive and urogenital systems, along with the kidneys, reproductive system, lymphatic and immune systems, and your cells. All are deeply connected and rely on structured, dynamized water to work together. By restoring this connection, Liquid Intelligence™ helps bring your body back into balance, supporting optimal health.<br/><br/>This process forms the foundation of The Aequil Reset, a structured two-month journey created to help rebalance the body from within. More than just a delivery method, Liquid Intelligence™ reflects a new way of thinking about supplements. It supports your body’s natural ability to heal and helps create lasting change.<br/><br/>Our bodies are made up of around 60 percent water by weight, and 99 percent of our molecules are water. Liquid Intelligence™ is built on this truth. By aligning with the water already in your body, it enhances nutrient absorption, supports communication between cells and encourages repair.

If so, mix with your favourite juice or water.</p><p><strong>Can I mix supplements with tea or smoothies?<br/></strong>Yes. You can mix them into water, tea, juice or smoothies. Just shake or stir well before drinking.</p><p><strong>Can I take 10ml at once instead of two 5ml doses?<br/></strong>Yes, but we recommend two 5ml doses for best results.</p><p><strong>Should I refrigerate Aequil products?<br/></strong>No. Store at room temperature, away from sunlight and heat.</p><p><strong>Can I take multiple Aequil products at once?<br/></strong>Yes. Our products are designed to work together as a system.</p><p><strong>Can I take Aequil longer than the reset period?<br/></strong>Yes. Many people continue using our products beyond the Signature Freedom System for ongoing support.</p><p><strong>Can I take it on a plane?<br/></strong>The full bottle is 300ml, so we recommend transferring it to a smaller, food-grade container if flying. Patches are safe to carry and wear while travelling.</p><p><strong>How should I shake the product?<br/></strong>Shake the supplement bottle for 5 seconds before use. If mixing with another drink, shake or stir again.</p>",

It includes three phases: Reset, Recharge and Maintain.</p><p><strong>Why is it called a reset or a rebirth?<br/></strong>Our system helps clear what no longer serves you and builds new foundations. Many describe it as starting over, from a clearer, more balanced place.</p><p><strong>Can I change the frequency or dose?<br/></strong>Always follow the recommended schedule. If needed, you can reduce the dose temporarily during detox. Return to the full schedule when ready.</p><p><strong>Why do I feel tired or worse during the process?<br/></strong>Detoxing can temporarily affect your energy. It means your body is clearing what it no longer needs. This is normal, but listen to your body.</p><p><strong>Why do I feel exhausted after the reset?<br/></strong>As your system clears toxins, it may take a moment to adjust. Give yourself time to feel the difference.</p><p><strong>What if detox feels too strong?<br/></strong>Pause for five days. You can restart with a lower dose, then gradually return to the schedule. If discomfort persists, contact us.</p><p><strong>What should I eat during the reset?<br/></strong>Eat as usual, but reducing sugar, alcohol, gluten and heavy foods may help your body respond more easily.</p><p><strong>Do I still need other supplements?<br/></strong>Aequil is designed to support your full system, so additional supplements are often not needed unless advised by a professional.</p>",

Our formulations are designed to support performance and recovery.</p><p><strong>Can I overdose on Aequil?<br/></strong>No, but detoxing too quickly can cause discomfort.

All ingredients are non-toxic.</p><p><strong>What if I get the solution in my eyes or a patch irritates my skin?<br/></strong>Rinse your eyes with water.
