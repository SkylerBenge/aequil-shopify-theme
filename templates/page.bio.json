His formulations are informed by his own clinical work, deep research into dynamised water, and a belief that coherence between body, mind, and energy is not a luxury - but a human right.</p><p><br/>He has published papers on structured water and vibrational imprinting, and has presented at international forums on topics like Lyme disease, stress, and biophysics. Several of his patients were hospitalised with Lyme-related brain infections, including encephalitis and meningitis - experiences that deepened his commitment to foundational, whole-system care.</p><p><br/>Frédéric continues to teach, research, and support practitioners around the world as AEQUIL grows into a new kind of wellness system.</p>",
